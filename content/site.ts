  narratives: {
    groom: `On an ordinary weekend with friends, Marzan noticed Nica across the room—calm, kind, and quietly radiant. A quick hello turned into easy laughter, and he felt an unexpected sense of peace, as if he had found someone who saw the world the way he did.

Their conversations spilled into late-night messages, coffee runs, and unhurried walks. The more they talked, the more Marzan realized how naturally Nica fit into every part of his life. Her warmth softened his edges; her faith and steadiness made him braver.

One evening, under a sky dotted with city lights, he knew he was no longer looking for “the right moment.” She was the moment. Choosing forever with Nica felt less like a decision and more like coming home.`,
    bride: `It's a moment Nica will forever return to: the sound of Marzan's voice calling her name.

She didn't know him then. They were strangers sharing space. But in that singular instant, Nica realized Marzan didn't just see her; he saw the truest, most unguarded version of her soul. In that recognition, their story began.

That instant blossomed into nearly ten incredible years. Ten years of unwavering love, genuine care, and shared history. Every season they have navigated together has proven one enduring truth: Marzan is Nica's calm in every storm.

His patience is not just a comfort Nica relies on; it is his quiet, powerful promise. A promise that he is staying, waiting, and never giving up. Marzan is, and always will be, her safe harbor.`,
